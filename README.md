# Magma [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/4lex-io/ember-magma.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/4lex-io/ember-magma)

## Designed for Ember.js

Magma is a bootstrap toolkit to easily create UI interfaces for Ember.js applications. It provides a list of useful UI components to be used in your Ember project.

## How does this work?
This toolkit contains reusable components you can assemble to build awesome things.

Better than too many words, please visit <http://4lex-io.github.io/ember-magma/> to see examples.

## Installation

A simple command line can make you use the addon right now. Simply run the following at the root level of your ember project:
```
ember install ember-magma
```

**Note:** This addon has been created based on Ember 2.0. It hasn't been tested on lower version of Ember yet.

## Themes

We understand that you don't always want to use the default styles coming from this addon. It often adds a lot of styles that you don't always want to use, and you might want to create your own theme for your application without overriding everything. For this reason, the default theme is not loaded by default in the application anymore.

If you decide you want to use the Magma theme, you will need to include it in the main sass file of your project.

```
@import 'node_modules/ember-magma/styles/themes/magma';
```
